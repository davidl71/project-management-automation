# TypeScript Development Rules

## Type Safety
- Always use explicit types, avoid `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `const` assertions where applicable

## Code Style
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Prefer async/await over raw Promises
- Use destructuring for cleaner code

## React (if applicable)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Keep components small and focused

## Testing
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Write tests for edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
