# Start of Day Workflow

Help me start my day with a project overview.

## Steps
1. Run `/exarp/project_scorecard` for health
2. Run `/exarp/list_tasks_awaiting_clarification` for blockers
3. Suggest top 3 tasks to work on based on priority
4. Note any security alerts or critical issues

## Questions to Answer
- What's the project health?
- What's blocking progress?
- What should I work on first?
