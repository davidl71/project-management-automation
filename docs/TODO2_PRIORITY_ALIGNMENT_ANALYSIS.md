## Design Constraint Violations

**Tool Count Limit (≤30 tools)**

The following tasks would create new tools and violate the design constraint:

- **98da663e-bfc6-4ff1-a7f7-8e73a7ea55bf**: Implement suggest_test_cases tool for Exarp
  - Priority: medium
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (43/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead

- **cb760617-2368-4edc-aeab-cde5b68fe387**: Implement validate_test_structure tool for Exarp
  - Priority: medium
  - Issue: Would create new tool when already at limit (43/30)
  - Recommendation: Consider consolidating with existing tools or using resources instead

- **1a70b180-5d12-4a59-aae7-6af084f68017**: Register MCP tools (5 tools: consult_advisor, get_wisdom, etc.)
