# Exarp MCP Transport Analysis


> 💡 **AI Assistant Hint:** For up-to-date, version-specific documentation on Python, use the Context7 MCP server by appending `use context7` to your prompts. For example:
> - "How do I use Python patterns? use context7"
> - "Show me Python examples examples use context7"
> - "Python best practices 2025 use context7"
>
> Context7 provides current documentation (2025), version-specific API references, and real code examples without hallucinations.

## Current Implementation

### Transport Type: **stdio**

Exarp currently uses the **stdio transport** mechanism, which is the recommended transport for MCP servers.

### Implementation Details

**Framework**: FastMCP 2.0
**Transport**: stdio (standard input/output)
**Protocol**: JSON-RPC over UTF-8 encoded messages

**Key Characteristics**:
- ✅ Server reads JSON-RPC messages from `stdin`
- ✅ Server writes JSON-RPC messages to `stdout`
- ✅ Logging goes to `stderr` (optional)
- ✅ Messages delimited by newlines
- ✅ No embedded newlines in messages
- ✅ Client launches server as subprocess

---

## Compliance with MCP Specification

### ✅ stdio Transport Requirements (Met)

1. **Message Encoding**: ✅ UTF-8 encoded JSON-RPC messages
2. **Message Delimiting**: ✅ Newline-delimited messages
3. **No Embedded Newlines**: ✅ Compliant (FastMCP handles this)
4. **stderr for Logging**: ✅ Logging goes to stderr
5. **stdout Only for MCP Messages**: ✅ FastMCP ensures this
6. **Client Launches Subprocess**: ✅ Cursor launches Exarp as subprocess

### Current Code Structure

```python
# FastMCP handles stdio transport automatically
if FastMCP:
    mcp = FastMCP("exarp")
    # Tools, resources, prompts registered
    mcp.run()  # Handles stdio communication
```

---

## Transport Options

### 1. stdio (Current) ✅

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple and reliable
- ✅ No network configuration needed
- ✅ Recommended by MCP specification
- ✅ Works well with Cursor and other MCP clients
- ✅ Secure (no network exposure)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Single client connection per server instance
- ❌ Server must be restarted for each client
- ❌ No server-to-client notifications without active request

**Status**: ✅ **Currently Implemented**

---

### 2. Streamable HTTP (Not Implemented)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Multiple client connections
- ✅ Server-to-client notifications
- ✅ Resumable connections
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Better for production deployments

**Cons**:
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Requires HTTP server setup
- ❌ Security considerations (Origin validation, authentication)
- ❌ Network configuration needed

**Status**: ❌ **Not Implemented**

**Requirements if Implemented**:
1. HTTP POST/GET endpoint support
2. SSE (Server-Sent Events) support
3. Session management (`Mcp-Session-Id` header)
4. Origin header validation
5. Authentication
6. Protocol version header (`MCP-Protocol-Version`)

---

## Recommendations

### Current State: ✅ Optimal

**Exarp's stdio transport is compliant and appropriate for its use case:**

1. **Primary Use Case**: Local development automation
   - stdio is perfect for local MCP servers
   - No network exposure needed
   - Simple deployment

2. **Client Compatibility**:
   - Works with Cursor (primary client)
   - Works with any MCP client supporting stdio
   - No additional configuration needed

3. **Security**:
   - No network exposure
   - No authentication needed
   - Secure by default

### Future Considerations

**HTTP Transport (Future Improvement):**

HTTP Transport could be added as a future enhancement if:
- Multiple clients need to connect simultaneously
- Server-to-client notifications are required
- Remote access is needed
- Production deployment requires HTTP

**Implementation Approach** (when needed):
- Use FastMCP's HTTP transport support (if available)
- Or implement custom HTTP transport following MCP spec
- Maintain stdio transport as primary/default
- Add configuration option to choose transport type

**Status**: ⏳ **Future Enhancement** - Not currently needed

---

## MCP Protocol Version

**Current**: FastMCP 2.0 (supports protocol version 2025-06-18)

**Protocol Version Header** (for HTTP transport):
```
MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18
```

**Note**: stdio transport doesn't use HTTP headers, but FastMCP handles protocol version negotiation during initialization.

---

## Compliance Summary

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| UTF-8 Encoding | ✅ | FastMCP handles |
| Newline Delimiting | ✅ | FastMCP handles |
| stderr Logging | ✅ | Python logging to stderr |
| stdout Only MCP | ✅ | FastMCP ensures |
| Subprocess Launch | ✅ | Client (Cursor) handles |
| HTTP Transport | ❌ | Not needed currently |
| Session Management | ❌ | Not needed for stdio |
| Protocol Version | ✅ | FastMCP 2.0 supports |

---

## Conclusion

**Exarp's current stdio transport implementation is:**
- ✅ **Fully compliant** with MCP specification
- ✅ **Appropriate** for its use case (local automation)
- ✅ **Secure** (no network exposure)
- ✅ **Simple** (no additional configuration)

**No changes needed** unless HTTP transport is required for specific use cases.
