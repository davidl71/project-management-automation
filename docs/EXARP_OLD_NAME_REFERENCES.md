# Exarp Old Name References Check

**Date**: 2025-11-26
**Status**: Analysis Complete

## Search Results

### "project_management_automation" / "project-management-automation"

**Note**: This is the **package name** and **directory name**. This should likely **stay as-is** because:
- It's the Python package name (descriptive)
- It's the directory structure (descriptive)
- Changing it would require massive refactoring
- The MCP server ID is already "exarp" (which is what matters)

**However**, we should check if any **user-facing** references need updating.

### "exarp" / "Exarp" / "EXARP"

**Note**: This is the **old project name** that should be replaced with "Exarp" in:
- Documentation
- Comments
- User-facing strings
- Descriptions

## Files to Check

1. **Package/Directory Name** (`project_management_automation`):
   - ✅ Keep as-is (Python package name)
   - ✅ Keep directory name (descriptive)
   - ⚠️ Check user-facing references

2. **Old Name** (`exarp`):
   - ❌ Replace in documentation
   - ❌ Replace in comments
   - ❌ Replace in user-facing strings
   - ❌ Replace in descriptions

## Next Steps

1. Review search results
2. Update user-facing references to "exarp" → "Exarp"
3. Keep package/directory names as-is (they're descriptive)
