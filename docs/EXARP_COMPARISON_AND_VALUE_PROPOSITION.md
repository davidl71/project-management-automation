## Exarp's Unique Value Proposition

### 1. Cross-Tool Intelligence (Unique)

**Problem**: Each PM tool operates in isolation—no way to analyze tasks across multiple tools.

**Exarp Solution**: Unified analysis across all PM tools

**Added Value**:
- **Cross-Tool Priority Analysis**: Understand priorities across Plane, Wekan, Taiga, etc.
- **Unified Task View**: See all tasks from all tools in one place
- **Cross-Tool Duplicate Detection**: Find duplicate tasks across different tools
- **Multi-Tool Aggregation**: Aggregate tasks from multiple PM tools

**Example**:
```python
# Exarp can analyze tasks from:
# - Plane projects
# - Wekan boards
# - Taiga user stories
# - OpenProject work packages
# - Todo2 tasks
# - Google Tasks
# - Markdown files
# - Jupyter Notebooks
# All in one unified analysis
```

### 2. Intelligent Automation (Unique)

**Problem**: PM tools manage tasks but don't automate analysis, optimization, or health checks.

**Exarp Solution**: Automated analysis, optimization, and health monitoring

**Added Value**:
- **Documentation Health**: Automated documentation analysis (not in any PM tool)
- **Task Alignment**: Analyze if tasks align with project goals (not in any PM tool)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Intelligent duplicate task detection (not in any PM tool)
- **Security Scanning**: Automated dependency security scanning (not in any PM tool)
- **Automation Discovery**: Find new automation opportunities (not in any PM tool)

**Example**:
```python

# - "Are my tasks aligned with project goals?"
# - "Do I have duplicate tasks across tools?"
# - "Is my documentation healthy?"
# - "Are my dependencies secure?"
# - "What can I automate?"
```

---

### 3. Multi-Project Aggregation (Unique)

**Problem**: PM tools work per-project—no unified view across multiple projects/repositories.

**Exarp Solution**: Aggregate tasks from multiple projects with unified overview

**Added Value**:
- **Multi-Project Overview**: See all tasks across all projects
- **Cross-Project Priority Analysis**: Understand priorities across projects
- **Project Ranking**: Rank projects by priority/importance
- **Unified Digest**: Interactive digest of all projects

**Example**:
```python
# Exarp can aggregate from:
# - Multiple Git repositories
# - Multiple PM tools (Plane, Wekan, Taiga, etc.)
# - Multiple task sources (MD files, Todo2, Google Tasks, etc.)
# All in one unified view
```

---

### 4. AI Assistant Integration (Unique)
